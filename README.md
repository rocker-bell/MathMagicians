## Description

**Math Magicians** is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that allows users to:

* Perform **simple calculations** using a calculator.
* Read a **random math-related quote** for inspiration.

By building this application, you will gain practical experience in **React** and **SPA development**.

## Features

1. **Calculator** – Allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Quotes Page** – Displays a random math-related quote every time you visit.
3. **Single Page App Navigation** – Seamless navigation between the calculator, quotes, and any additional pages.

## 🛠 How to Build the Math Magicians Website

1. **Start with the Calculator:**

   * Build the **core functionality** first.
   * Begin with the **UI layout** based on medium-fidelity wireframes.
   * Implement all basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

2. **Expand to Full Website:**

   * Integrate the calculator into a **full SPA**.
   * Add **3 sub-pages** (Calculator, Quotes, and one additional page of your choice).
   * Ensure smooth **navigation without page reloads**.

3. **Work Collaboratively:**

   * Some project steps involve **pair programming**.
   * Use version control (**Git & GitHub**) to manage your project effectively.
